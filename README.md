# House-Price-Prediction

The uploaded **House Price Prediction** project focuses on predicting the prices of houses using machine learning.

---

### **Project Objective**
The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a house based on various features such as the number of rooms, location, and other real estate factors. This is a **regression problem** where the target variable is a continuous value (house price).

---

### **Dataset**
The project uses the **Boston Housing Dataset**, a well-known dataset for regression tasks. Key details about the dataset:
- **Features**: Includes parameters like:
  - `RM`: Number of rooms per dwelling
  - `LSTAT`: Percentage of lower-status population
  - `PTRATIO`: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
  - `TAX`: Property tax rate
  - `DIS`: Distance to employment centers
  - Many more features relevant to housing prices.
- **Target Variable**: 
  - `MEDV`: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.

### **Steps in the Project**
1. **Data Import and Exploration**:
   - The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
   - The structure of the dataset is examined using shape, summary statistics, and visual exploration.
   - Missing values are checked and handled if necessary.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualizations are created using **matplotlib** and **seaborn** to understand relationships between features and the target variable.
   - Example: Scatter plots to observe the correlation between `RM` (number of rooms) and `MEDV` (house price).

3. **Data Splitting**:
   - The dataset is divided into **training** and **testing** sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.
   - This ensures that the model is trained on one subset and evaluated on unseen data.

4. **Model Selection**:
   - The project uses **XGBoost Regressor**, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy in prediction tasks.
   - This algorithm builds an ensemble of decision trees to minimize prediction errors.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - The XGBoost Regressor is trained on the training dataset.
   - Predictions are made on the testing dataset.
   - Performance metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **R-squared score** are calculated to evaluate model performance.

### **Applications**
This project has practical real-world applications, such as:
- **Real Estate Market Analysis**: Assisting buyers, sellers, and agents in estimating house prices based on key features.
- **Urban Planning**: Understanding the factors that influence property prices for better city planning and zoning decisions.
- **Financial Forecasting**: Helping banks and financial institutions evaluate loan and mortgage risks.

---

### **Summary**
The **House Price Prediction** project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to solve regression problems. By leveraging the **XGBoost Regressor**, the model accurately predicts housing prices based on various factors. The project highlights:
- Data preprocessing and visualization.
- The use of advanced machine learning algorithms like XGBoost.
- Evaluation of model performance using standard regression metrics.
